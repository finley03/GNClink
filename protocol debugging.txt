System fails if requested frame resend also fails to send.
Frequency: O(n^2) failed frames
Cause: Unconfigured timeouts on the ground station
Solution: Configure timeouts
Status: Fixed

Ground station reads incorrect names of variables
Cause: Ground station unaware when zero bytes are read and the connection times out, reinterprets previous data
Solution: Check if data is received at the frame level, redo entire transaction if this fails. Also check packet passes test and redo transaction if that fails too.
Status: Fixed
